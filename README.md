# Prediction of hERG Channel Blockage

> This project aims to use Ersilia's cardiotoxnet-herg(eos2ta5) model to predict the probability of chemical compounds   toxicity to the hERG gene. The hERG gene is crucial to heart action, small molecules blocking the gene could lead to potential heart dsyfunction, due to this, the hERG gene is a big concern for pharmaceutical companies and has lead to drugs that cause hERG-related cardiotoxicity being withdrawn from the market.
